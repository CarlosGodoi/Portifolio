			"title": "About",
			"description": "I am a web developer with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development from Ritter dos Reis University. I have been working in the technology field since 2008, when I started my career in infrastructure. I worked in this field for almost 11 years and, in 2019, I decided to move to the development field, where I found my true passion and calling. I worked in a software factory for 2 years and 4 months as a front-end developer, where I gained experience with React.js, Next.js and their entire ecosystem. I participated in projects for companies such as Ouro e Prata, CrÃ©dito Real and Essent Jus. During this period, I also acquired knowledge and experience with backend, collaborating on projects with Node.js, Express and Prisma. I have experience working in agile and self-managed teams. My skills include teamwork, flexibility, adaptability, proactivity and communication. I am always evolving technically and personally, always seeking new challenges for my development as a developer."
